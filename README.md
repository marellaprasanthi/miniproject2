CompanyStructure Class
The CompanyStructure class contains the main method for testing.

It creates instances of various employees and managers, adds direct reports, and prints their statuses to test the functionality of the classes.

Each class is structured to represent different types of employees within the company hierarchy, with methods that allow them to interact

with each other and perform their specific roles in the organization. The inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes help to establish

relationships and code sharing among these classes.
